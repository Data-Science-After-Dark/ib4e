# I before E exploratory analysis
A just-for-fun exploratory analysis project presented by Chad Boschert at the inagural [Data Science After Dark](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-After-Dark/) meetup in Springfield, MO on August 20th, 2019.


## Project Overview
This project includes 3 Jupyter Notebooks. Each numbered notebook digs deeper into the heuristic "I before E except after C" using an english words database borrowed from [@dwyl](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)
